Controls for the flashlight, fog, and day/night are in the console.

Opening the console is with 2, 2 finger tap, as the assignment requests.

The enemy cube is loaded from the numberedCube3.obj file using the CubeNumbered4.png file for textures

To toggle the cubes stationary status, double tap on the cube.

NOTE: Cube movements are oriented around where you are facing, so “forward” to the cube means “forward” to the camera

To move the cube in stationary mode:
- Swipe Left/Right to move it left /right
- Swipe Up/Down to move it forwards/backwards
- Swipe Up/Down with Three Fingers to move it upwards/downwards

To rotate the cube in stationary mode:
- Swipe Left/Right with Two Fingers to rotate the cube

To scale the cube bigger/smaller:
- Swipe Up/Down with Two Fingers to scale the cube bigger/smaller

Click Detection Note:
On the iPhone 7 Plus simulator, the pixel color detection code works 100% of the time (according to our testing)
On the physical iPods rented out, the pixel color detection works right the first time, then detects an RGB value of (1/255, 0, 0) every tap
The result is it works properly on the simulator, but it thinks every single tap is on the model when using the physical iPod
